# no-framework-site

I'm starting over with pure HTML only. If the site is truly worthwhile, it should be able to stand on its own with just HTML. If it’s navigable and functional, then it works. Otherwise, I’ll keep refining.

My goal is to make my site terminal browser friendly, then move into the browsers and slowly add CSS / JS if needed.

## Goals
- Terminal-browser friendly (Lynx, w3m, etc.)
- Minimal, accessible structure
- Add CSS/JS incrementally, only if needed
- No fancy features / frameworks or automation unless it earns it's place.
